# Sportschemy - Sports addon for [Wowchemy](https://wowchemy.com/) website builder

[Wowchemy](https://wowchemy.com/) is an amazing website builder for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) SSG. Its main focus is on academic/scientific websites, but it can be used for any kind of content.

I decided to rewrite the [website of my basketball club](https://pallacanestroarcella.netlify.app/) with this framework, leaving the previous one developed in WordPress. I think the result is very good by just using the built-in components; however, I would like to try to implement something a bit fancier.

The inspiration is the [SportsPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/sportspress/) plugin for WordPress.

> :warning: This extension uses the v2 block system, which is the default from Wowchemy 5.8.

## Roadmap

- [ ] New `match`
- [ ] Event importer from `csv`
- [ ] Widgets and shortcodes for previous/next games
