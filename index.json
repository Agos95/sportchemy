[{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Table of Contents Archetype Parameters Archetype Sportchemy defines a new archetype named match which represents a single game.\nEach game is defined in its own markdown file under the content/match/ directory. To create a new match:\nhugo new --kind match match/my-match-name.md An example of a match file is:\n--- title: Los Angeles Lakers vs Golden State Warriors summary: # just for compatibility, not yet used # match date (YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss) # format must be \u0026#39;YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss\u0026#39;, otherwise ordering and sorting in blocks don\u0026#39;t work date: 2022-10-18 22:00:00 # Teams info home: name: Los Angeles Lakers logo: https://content.sportslogos.net/logos/6/237/full/uig7aiht8jnpl1szbi57zzlsh.png away: name: Golden State Warriors logo: https://content.sportslogos.net/logos/6/235/full/3152_golden_state_warriors-primary-2020.png # Final Score score: home: 109 away: 123 # Match details season: 2022-23 league: NBA tournament: Regular Season matchDay: court: name: Chase Center # optional address: Chase Center, San Francisco, California # optional link: https://goo.gl/maps/Dwk6Ua7ek4msvCz99 # optional lat: # not yet used long: # not yet used # Schedule page publish date (NOT match date). publishDate: 2022-09-01 tags: [] # Is this a featured match? (true/false) featured: false --- Parameters title: Title of the match\nsummary: Present to be aligned with other Wowchemy archetypes, but not used\ndate: Match date. It must be in the format YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss, otherwise sorting in blocks does not work\nhome, away: Dictionaries containing information about the home and away team; keys are:\nname: Team name logo: Logo image for the team. It can be both a remote image (as in the example above), or an image stored in assets/media/.\nSince it is common to have multiple matches per single team, you can also define the mapping between team names and logos in the file data/sportchemy/team_logo.yaml (create it with the intermediate directories if necessary). An example of this file is: Atlanta Hawks: https://content.sportslogos.net/logos/6/220/full/8190_atlanta_hawks-primary-2021.png Boston Celtics: https://content.sportslogos.net/logos/6/213/full/boston_celtics_logo_primary_19977628.png Charlotte Hornets: https://content.sportslogos.net/logos/6/5120/full/1926_charlotte__hornets_-primary-2015.png Chicago Bulls: https://content.sportslogos.net/logos/6/221/full/chicago_bulls_logo_primary_19672598.png Dallas Mavericks: https://content.sportslogos.net/logos/6/228/full/3463_dallas_mavericks-primary-2018.png Denver Nuggets: https://content.sportslogos.net/logos/6/229/full/8926_denver_nuggets-primary-2019.png Golden State Warriors: https://content.sportslogos.net/logos/6/235/full/3152_golden_state_warriors-primary-2020.png Houston Rockets: https://content.sportslogos.net/logos/6/230/full/6830_houston_rockets-primary-2020.png Indiana Pacers: https://content.sportslogos.net/logos/6/224/full/4812_indiana_pacers-primary-2018.png Los Angeles Lakers: https://content.sportslogos.net/logos/6/237/full/uig7aiht8jnpl1szbi57zzlsh.png Miami Heat: https://content.sportslogos.net/logos/6/214/full/burm5gh2wvjti3xhei5h16k8e.gif Milwaukee Bucks: NBA/milwaukee_bucks_logo_primary_20165763.png New Orleans Pelicans: NBA/2681_new_orleans_pelicans-primary-2014.png Orlando Magic: NBA/orlando_magic_logo_primary_20117178.png Philadelphia 76ers: NBA/7034_philadelphia_76ers-primary-2016.png Phoenix Suns: NBA/phoenix_suns_logo_primary_20143696.png San Antonio Spurs: NBA/2547_san_antonio_spurs-primary-2018.png Toronto Raptors: NBA/7024_toronto_raptors-primary-2021.png Utah Jazz: NBA/utah_jazz_logo_primary_2023_sportslogosnet-8513.png The logic to assign the logo is the following: Use logo parameter in the Front Matter, if present. Look in data/sportchemy/team_logo.yaml, searching for the team name. Use a fallback image. Default is , but you can change it by creating the image assets/media/sportchemy/team-placeholder.png with your own placeholder. score: Final score of the game. This is a dictionary with the keys:\nhome: Points for the Home team. away: Points for the Away team. season, league, tournament, matchDay: Additional match information, useful when filtering games in blocks.\ncourt: Playing field information; it is a dicionary with the keys:\nname: Name of the playground. address: Address of the playground. link: Link to attach to the field name (for example a Google Maps link). lat, long: Latitude and Longitude of the playground (not used yet). In blocks, a url is associated to the field name; it is constructed using the following logic:\nUse link parameter. Use https://maps.google.com?{address}, sanitizing the address. Use https://maps.google.com?{name}, sanitizing the address. Fallback to # (“empty” link). publishDate: Schedule page publish date (not match date). Hugo does not publish files with a future publishDate.\nIf you don’t need to work with different timezones, I suggest to add your timezone to the config/_defaul/config.yaml file (choosing from this list), such as: …","date":1676674800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":1676674800,"objectID":"b18dc878e3ee9362b2e15934d24ddaf0","permalink":"https://agos95.github.io/sportchemy/docs/match/","publishdate":"2023-02-18T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/sportchemy/docs/match/","section":"docs","summary":"A match is a new archetype which represents a single game.","tags":null,"title":"Match","type":"book"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Table of Contents Usage Parameters Filters Views Card View Table View View Hooks Usage Sportchemy defines a new block called sportchemy-collection.

Card View The sportchemy-card-view layout displays games using Bootstrap cards:\nCards are arranged in 3, 2 or 1 columns, depending on the screen size.\nTable View The sportchemy-table-view layout displays games using a Table:\nView Hooks Differently from Wowchemy, Sportchemy views are called inside a hook function:\nsportchemy-card-view-hook creates a \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;row justify-content-center\u0026#34;\u0026gt;, where ther columns containing the cards are inserted. sportchemy-table-view-hook defines the header row of the Table; then each match is rendered as a row.
